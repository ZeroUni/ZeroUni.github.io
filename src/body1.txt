<h1>THE POWER OF THE SUN IN THE PALM OF MY HAND</h1>
<p>
	Nuclear fission is already a strong, clean contender for long term energy as a stand-in for renewables, but what if we made it better? Nuclear fusion, until now just a pipe dream, has recently made huge advances, including an output test that managed to create more energy out than was used to reach fusion conditions[4]. Fusion is the same power that is generated by stars, and is that which creates the universe and matter around us. It is more efficient than fission, while being cleaner and more compact than renewable energy sources.
	Fusion energy is the densest form of energy generation possible with our current knowledge and insights. One gram of DT fusion fuel is able to generate an equal amount of energy as compared to 55 barrels of oil (1 USP Barrel is approx. 159 kilograms of oil[5]), and produces near zero byproducts for future generations to worry about[6].

    <strong>COST EFFECTIVENESS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    While the cost of construction of a nuclear power plant costs a pretty penny, the low operation costs and the tremendous electricity output heavily outweighs the cost of the investment. For comparison, one gram of uranium can produce the same amount of electricity as three tons of coal[2], while emitting much less carbon dioxide. Nuclear powerâ€™s carbon emissions typically range between 15-50g per kilowatt hour, coal has a comparative output of 1050g per kilowatt hour[3].

<h2>SAFETY OF NUCLEAR POWER</h2>
<p>When most people think of Nuclear energy, Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island are usually the first things that comes to mind. While these disasters were terrible, they <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#1b6d1e6d79f9">are not</a> the most dangerous ways to generate electricity. In fact, coal plants emit more radiation into the atmosphere than nuclear plants.</p>

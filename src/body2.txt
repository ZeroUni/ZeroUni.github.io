<h1>THE POWER OF THE SUN IN THE PALM OF MY HAND</h1>
<p>
	Nuclear fission is already a strong, clean contender for long term energy as a stand-in for renewables, but what if we made it better? Nuclear fusion, until now just a pipe dream, has recently made huge advances, including an output test that managed to create more energy out than was used to reach fusion conditions<sup>[4]</sup>. Fusion is the same power that is generated by stars, and is that which creates the universe and matter around us. It is more efficient than fission, while being cleaner and more compact than renewable energy sources.
	Fusion energy is the densest form of energy generation possible with our current knowledge and insights. One gram of DT fusion fuel is able to generate an equal amount of energy as compared to 55 barrels of oil (1 USP Barrel is approx. 159 kilograms of oil<sup>[5]</sup>), and produces near zero byproducts for future generations to worry about<sup>[6]</sup>.

    <strong>COST EFFECTIVENESS</strong>
</h1>
<p>
    While the cost of construction of a nuclear power plant costs a pretty penny, the low operation costs and the tremendous electricity output heavily outweighs the cost of the investment. For comparison, one gram of uranium can produce the same amount of electricity as three tons of coal<sup>[2]</sup>, while emitting much less carbon dioxide. Nuclear powerâ€™s carbon emissions typically range between 15-50g per kilowatt hour, coal has a comparative output of 1050g per kilowatt hour<sup>[3]</sup>.

<h1><strong>
    SAFETY OF NUCLEAR POWER
</strong></h1>
<p>When most people think of Nuclear energy, Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island are usually the first things that comes to mind. While these disasters were terrible, they <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#1b6d1e6d79f9">are not</a> the most dangerous ways to generate electricity. In fact, coal plants emit more radiation into the atmosphere than nuclear plants.</p>

Why Clean Energy?</b></strong></h1>

<p> 
 
As you know, our world is facing a climate crisis. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, is releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, leading toward the raising of Earthâ€™s natural temperature. This is leading to more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and other environmental problems.</p>
